# Graph Generator
 Graph generator for generating text files with coordinates.
 Coordinates, Neighbour, Weight

 When running the program you will be promped to enter a grid size (it will only generate a square, so only one number is needed), The probability for a coordinate to be a wall and a name for the file.
 A photo will then spawn and the 2 first left clicks, will set the starting position and the target position.
 (Try and come as close as you can to the desired coordinates). 
 Then close the window and the files will be created in the folder that the terminal is in.
